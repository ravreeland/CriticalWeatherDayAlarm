## Introduction ##
I made this alarm to automate checking whether a critical weather day was declared. I had missed on CWD being declared during a shift, and figured I could have an application check it the background on my work laptop, and trigger a window's notification. I got rid of the functionality for the creation of an email template, as I wanted to play it safe with no info about work related stuff on this github.
